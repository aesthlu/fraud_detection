# Fraud Detection – End-to-End Data Science Project

## Description

This project implements an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline for fraud detection**, from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation, experiment tracking, and deployment.

It is designed to showcase **practical Data Science and Machine Learning skills** required in real-world industrial contexts, where challenges include **highly imbalanced datasets**, **metric selection driven by business constraints**, and **reproducibility**.

The project also integrates **MLOps practices**, such as experiment tracking with MLflow and deployment through a REST API.

### Key Features

- Supervised fraud detection models
- Handling of highly imbalanced data (undersampling, SMOTE)
- Robust evaluation using ROC-AUC and Precision-Recall metrics
- Experiment tracking and model versioning
- Containerized deployment with a prediction API

## Project Objectives

- Detect fraudulent transactions using supervised machine learning
- Handle **highly imbalanced data**, a key challenge in fraud detection
- Build reproducible and well-structured ML pipelines
- Track experiments and compare models
- Deploy a trained model via a production-ready API
